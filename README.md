# Shitify
Shitify is a tool to make your code / text file look awful! (And possibly break it)
This tool is shitty so it will delete the spaces on strings as well. I could not finda fix for this. If you know how to fix it, you can send a pull request.
I will create an installer for this later today (20.09.2020) most probably.
For now you can just run it through the terminal or Visual Studio Code.

<h1> Running the app </h1>
<p> First open the directory in Visual Studio Code, or just use "cd [directory]" </p>
<h3> Visual Studio Code </h3>
<p> Create new terminal and then type "npm start" </p>
<h3> Terminal </h3>
<p> Use the "cd" command to cd to the directory. </p>
<p> Then just type "npm start" </p>

<h1> How to use the app </h1>
<p> Click select file located in the bottom </p>
<p> Select your file that you want to "shitify" </p>
<p> Save it (preferred: save as a different file so you always have your original code) </p>
<p> Open the file, and then remove the quotes. </p>

<h1> Bugs that I could not fix </h1>
<ul>
  <li> Spaces in strings get deleted. </li>
  <li> Because the content is saved as a string, the file automatically has quotes in the beginninng and end. </li>
</ul>
